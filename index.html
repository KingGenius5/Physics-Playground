      <h1>Intro to Linear Motion: Move It</h1>
      <h2>Motion is Relative</h2>
      <p>Everything moves—even things that appear to be at rest. They move relative to
        the Sun and stars. As you’re reading this, you’re moving at about 107,000 kilometers per hour relative to the Sun, and you’re moving even faster relative to the
        center of our galaxy. When we discuss the motion of something, we describe the
        motion relative to something else. If you walk down the aisle of a moving bus,
        your speed relative to the floor of the bus is likely quite different from your speed
        relative to the road. When we say a racing car reaches a speed of 300 kilometers
        per hour, we mean relative to the track. Unless stated otherwise, when we discuss the speeds of things in our environment, we mean relative to the surface of
        Earth. Motion is relative.</p>

      <h1>Atoms: They're All Around Us</h1>
      <h2>Atomic Structure</h2>
      <p>The principal building block of the nucleus is the nucleon, which is in turn composed of fundamental particles called quarks. When a nucleon is in an electrically
        neutral state, it is a neutron; when it is in a positively charged state, it is a proton.
        All protons are identical; they are copies of one another. Likewise with neutrons:
        Each neutron is like every other neutron. The lighter nuclei have roughly equal
        numbers of protons and neutrons; more massive nuclei have more neutrons than
        protons. Protons have a positive electric charge that repels other positive charges
        but attracts negative charges. So like kinds of electric charges repel one another,
        and unlike charges attract one another. It is the positive protons in the nucleus that
        attract a surrounding cloud of negatively charged electrons to constitute an atom. </p>

      <h1>Buoyancy: Whatever Floats Your Boat</h1>
      <h2>Buoyant Force</h2>
      <p>Anyone who has ever lifted a heavy submerged object out of water is familiar with
        buoyancy, the apparent loss of weight experienced by objects submerged in a liquid. For example, lifting a large boulder off the bottom of a riverbed is a relatively
        easy task as long as the boulder is below the surface. When the boulder is lifted
        above the surface, however, the force required to lift it is increased considerably.
        This is because, when the boulder is submerged, the water exerts an upward force
        on it that is exactly opposite to the direction of gravity’s pull. This upward force
        is called the buoyant force, and it is a consequence of pressure increasing with
        depth. Figure 13.9 shows why the buoyant force acts upward. Forces due to water
        pressure are exerted everywhere against the boulder in a direction perpendicular to
        its surface, as shown by the vectors. Force vectors against the sides at equal depths
        cancel one another, so there is no horizontal buoyant force. Force vectors in the
        vertical direction, however, don’t cancel. Pressure is greater against the bottom of
        the boulder because the bottom is deeper. So upward forces against the bottom are
        greater than downward forces against the top, producing a net force upward—the
        buoyant force.</p>

      <h1>Thermodynamics: Get Outta The Kitchen</h1>
      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>Kelvin was the first to coin the word thermodynamics (which stems from Greek
        words meaning “movement of heat”). The science of thermodynamics was developed in the early 19th century, before the atomic and molecular theory of matter
        was understood. Because the early workers in thermodynamics had only vague notions of atoms and knew nothing about electrons and other microscopic particles,
        the models they used invoked macroscopic notions—such as mechanical work,
        pressure, and temperature—and their roles in energy transformations.
        The two foundation stones of thermodynamics are the conservation of energy
        and the fact that heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold and not the other way
        around. Thermodynamics provides the basic theory of heat engines, from steam
        turbines to nuclear reactors, and the basic theory of refrigerators and heat pumps.
        The laws of thermodynamics dashed the dreams of inventors and industrialists
        who believed in the possibility of a perpetual motion machine: a device that, upon
        receiving an initial input of energy, would continue to operate indefinitely without
        further input. We begin our study of thermodynamics with a look at one of its
        early concepts—a lower limit to temperature. </p>
